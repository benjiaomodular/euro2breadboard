# euro2breadboard

A simple breadboard power adapter for Eurorack module development.

## Versions
### v1.0 Initial design
- Power rails work great.
- Holes of toggle switch were a bit too tight.
- Spacing of outer pins off with actual breadboard power rails. Can be resolved by soldering while installed on breadboard.

### v1.1 Quick fixes
- Spacing of power rail pins was improved.
- Updated footprint of toggle switch. Made the drill holes a bit wider.
- Switched the position of the toggle and the LEDs so you can see the lights better.
